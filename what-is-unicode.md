# What is Unicode?

What is Unicode and why is the #MorePrideEmojis campaign focusing on them?  The Unicode Consortium is a non-profit group that essentially "owns" emojis.  They keep the official list of emojis and act as the gatekeepers for new emojis.  A lot of people mistakenly think that Apple or Google or Microsoft or Twitter are responsible for creating emojis, but they all rely on what Unicode says.

This means that if you want a new emoji, you don't ask Google or Apple.  You have to ask Unicode.

To understand why, let's take a short trip back in time...

## The Chaos of the Olden Days

Today, if you visit a website that's in English, it will be displayed in Latin characters.  Arabic sites use Arabic, Russian sites are Cyrillic, Japanese sites are in Kanji, Hiragana, or Katakana, and so on.  On some sites, you can see all these different languages on the same page.  And it all just _works_.

This was not always the case.

Computers work on numbers.  That's all they know.  All these letters you're reading right now are numbers to the computer.  This page tells your browser "Please show character 65" and the browser puts an "A" on the page. This works because my keyboard and your browser both agree that character 65 is the letter "A".  But there's no natural connection between the number 65 and the letter A.  There's no particular reason why my keyboard and my computer couldn't say that the letter A is actually number 193.  As long as it's consistent on my end, where I hit the A key and see an A on the screen, I don't care what that number is.  But _you_ care, because if I say that A is 193 and send you a file like that, your browser is going to show you something like â”´ instead of an A.

That's literally how computers used to be.  Different systems used different numbers to represent letters, like some electronic Tower of Babel.  The end result was that if you tried to share anything between two different systems, it could turn into a corrupted mess.

Eventually, a consistent standard called ASCII won the day.  ASCII was great!  It had all the letters and numbers and some punctuation.  Now, when I typed an A, you'd see an A on your end, and when I typed a "ç«œ", you'd see a...  Well, you'd see something like "Ã§Â«Å“"...  

ASCII was designed with English in mind and was extended to cover most of the characters used by other Western European languages, but it doesn't cover anything outside of that.  Whenever other languages got involved, computers were right back at the electronic Tower of Babel.  You'd have to tell your computer "This is supposed to be Japanese" for it to understand that it needed to display the page as Japanese instead of as a jumble of Latin characters, and it still would only do that if you had the right fonts installed.  And if you didn't know that something was supposed to be Japanese, good luck trying to figure that out from the random characters on your screen.  That's obviously a problem for an increasingly interconnected world of computers.

This is where Unicode comes in.

The goal of Unicode is define a UNIversal enCODing for text on computers.  That means that my A is your A, your ç«œ is my ç«œ.  Unicode does this by standardizing the numbers behind the characters for pretty much every language on the planet.  A is 65.  ç«œ is 31452.  And ðŸ˜€ is 128512.
