# {{ include.flagname }} Flag Emoji

Clearly, this is not the {{ include.flagname | downcase }} flag.  But according to Unicode, it's good enough.  They've told us to "leverage existing Unicode symbols" to make our flags, and this is the result.

It's clear that existing symbols are not sufficient to represent the {{ include.flagnameshort | downcase }} flag.  Existing symbols force us to use something like {{ include.flagemojis }}, which is utterly ridiculous.  The colors don't match, you have to already know what it's supposed to be in order to recognize it, it's {{ include.flagemojis | size }} characters instead of one, and worst of all, it may look entirely different on your device, as different companies have different looking emojis.
